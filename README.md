# MiniSearch 0.1

This repository contains the source code for the MiniSearch meta-search
language, which includes the MiniZinc 2.1beta constraint modelling language and
tool chain. It provides a backend that supports all FlatZinc solvers.

**This repository is no longer under active development. MiniSearch is not
guaranteed to be compatible with newer versions of MiniZinc and might fail to
work in some ways in general.**

With MiniSearch you can express and run many advanced meta-searches,
such as lexicographic optimisation, large neighbourhood search,
and/or search and diverse solution search.

Have a look at the MiniSearch webpage for a detailed documentation:

## Compilation

To compile the sources, you require cmake (version 2.8.7 or newer),
flex, bison and a C++ compiler. Follow the instructions below for
your OS in a terminal.

- Linux and Mac OS \*
  Create a build/ folder in the current directory and change into it
  and execute cmake and make:

      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..
      make

After compilation the build/ folder will contain the binary file
minisearch. See 'Getting Started' on how to execute it.

Note: The instructions above will compile the sources for a 64bit
machine. If you are compiling for a 32-bit architecture, then set
the cmake option 'BUILD_32BIT' by:

    cmake -DBUILD_32BIT=ON ..

### Windows

Create a build/ folder in the current directory and change into it
and execute cmake where you set the project file type, for instance
Visual Studio 12 (type 'cmake --help' to get a list of all project
file generators):

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G"Visual Studio 12 2013" ..
    cmake --build .

After compilation the build/Debug folder will contain the binary file
minisearch.exe. See 'Getting Started' on how to execute it.

Note: The instructions above will compile the sources for a 32bit
machine. If you are compiling for a 64-bit architecture, then set
the cmake option for a 64bit architecture, for instance:

    cmake -G"Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" ..

** Building the binary package **

You can create the binary package using the following command
(after compilation) in the build/ directory:

cmake --build . --target package

This will create a .tar.gz (Linux and Mac OS) or .zip file (Windows)
in the build/ directory that contains the binary package.

** Getting Started **

- Linux and Mac OS \*
  After compilation, the minisearch binary file is in the build/
  directory and you can find MiniSearch examples in the directory:
  tests/minisearch/regression_tests/. You can run an example with
  your FlatZinc solver <fzn-solver> by typing, for instance

./build/minisearch --solver <fzn-solver> tests/minisearch/regression_tests/golomb_lns.mzn

into your shell in this directory. Check out the documentation on
how to get a FlatZinc solver if have not got any installed on your
system.

Note that you also have to set the MiniZinc standard library path
$MZN_STDLIB_DIR to share/minizinc/ since it contains the MiniSearch
builtin definitions. You can also manually set the stdlib path by
adding the --stdlib-dir option to calling minisearch:

./build/minisearch --solver <fzn-solver> --stdlib-dir share/minizinc/ tests/minisearch/regression_tests/golomb_lns.mzn

- Windows \*
  After compilation, the minisearch binary file is in the
  build/Debug directory and you can find MiniSearch examples in
  the directory: tests/minisearch/regression_tests. You can run an
  example with your FlatZinc solver <fzn-solver.exe> by typing, for
  instance

cd build/Debug
minisearch.exe --solver <fzn-solver.exe> ../../tests/minisearch/regression_tests/golomb_lns.mzn

Note that you also have to set the MiniZinc standard library path
$MZN_STDLIB_DIR to share/minizinc since it contains the MiniSearch
builtin definitions. You can also manually set the stdlib path by
adding the --stdlib-dir option to calling minisearch:

minisearch.exe --solver <fzn-solver.exe> --stdlib-dir ../../share/minizinc ../../tests/minisearch/regression_tests/golomb_lns.mzn
